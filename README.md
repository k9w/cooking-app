## Description

_Welcome to the third project with JavaScript assigned by [Epicodus](https://epicodus.com) before introducing jQuery. Specifically, it demonstrates separation of Business Logic and User Interface Logic in a specialized calculator web app for cleaner, easier-to-read JavaScript code. The app's specialty is to convert between units of temperature._

[The
lesson](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/javascript-and-jquery/practice-calculator-business-logic)
from [the curriculum](https://learnhowtoprogram.com) for this project was originally assigned for pair programming during class time on Monday January 10th 2022. We rushed through it and did not publish our work (to my knowledge). I went through it later on my own starting on Sunday February 20th. Check out more of my work at:
